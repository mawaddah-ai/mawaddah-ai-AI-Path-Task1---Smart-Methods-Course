Transcribed Text:
 the i was twenty seven years old i left a very demanding job in management consulting for a job that was even more demanding teaching i went to teach seventh graders math in the new york city public schools and like any teacher i made quizzes and tests i gave out homework assignments when the work came back i calculated grades what struck me was that i q was not the only difference between my best and my worst students some of my strongest performers did not have stratospheric i q scores some of my smartest kids weren't doing so well and that got me thinking kinds of things you need to learn in seventh grade math sure there are hard ratios decimals the area of a p parallelogram but these concepts are not impossible and i was firmly convinced that every one of my students could learn the material if they worked hard and long enough after several more years of teaching i came to the conclusion that what we need in education is a much better understanding of students and learning from a motivational perspective from a psychological perspective in education the one thing we know how to measure best is i q huh but what if doing well in school and in life depends on much more than your ability to learn quickly and easily so i left the classroom and went to graduate school to become a psychologist i started studying kids and adults in all kinds of super challenging settings and in every study my question was who is successful here and why my research team and i went to west point military academy why we tried to predict which cadets would stay in military training and which would drop out we went to the national spelling v and tried to predict which children would advance farthest in competition we studied rookie teachers working in really tough neighborhoods asking which teachers are still going to be here in teaching by the end of the school year and of those who will be the most effective at improving learning outcomes for their students we partnered with private companies asking which of these salespeople is going to keep their jobs and who's going to earn the most money and all those very different contexts one characteristic he emerged as a significant predictor of success and it wasn't social intelligence wasn't good looks physical health and it wasn't i q it was grit grit is passion and perseverance for very long term goals grit is having stamina grit is sticking with your future day in day out not just for the week not just for the month but for years and working really hard to make that future a reality the grit is living life like it's a marathon not a sprint a few years ago i started studying grit in the chicago public schools i asked thousands of high school juniors to take great questionnaires and then waited around more than a year to see who would graduate turns out that grittier kids were significantly more likely to graduate even when i matched them on every characteristic i could measure things like family income standardized achievement test scores even how safe kids felt when they were at school so it's not just at west point or the national spelling bee that grip matters it's also in school especially for kids at risk for dropping out to me the most shocking thing about grit is how little we know how little science knows about building it every day parents and teachers asked me how do i build gritten kids what do i do to teach kids a solid work ethic how do i keep them motivated for the long run the honesty answer is i don't know what i do know is that talent doesn't make you gritty our data show very clearly that there are many talented individuals who simply do not follow through on their commitments in fact in our data grit is usually unrelated or even inversely related to measures of talent so far the best idea i've heard about building grit in kids is something called growth mindset this is an idea developed at stanford university by carol dweck and it is the belief that the ability to learn is not fixed that it can change with your effort dr dweck has shown that when kids read and learn about the brain and how it changes and grows in response to challenge they're much more likely to persevere when they fail because they don't believe that failure is a permanent condition so growth mindset is a great idea for building grit but we need more and that's where i'm going to end my remarks because that's where we are that's the work that stands before us we need to take our best ideas our strongest intuitions and we need to test them we need to measure whether we've been successful and we have to be willing to fail to be wrong to start over again with lessons learned in other words we need to be gritty about getting our kids grittier thank you the
Response Text:
 The speaker, a former management consultant turned teacher, shares their journey from teaching seventh-grade math in New York City public schools to becoming a psychologist focused on understanding student success. They observed that IQ alone didn’t predict academic performance; instead, they noticed that **grit**—defined as passion and perseverance for long-term goals—was a significant predictor of success across various challenging contexts, including West Point, the National Spelling Bee, teaching in tough neighborhoods, and sales roles.

Their research in Chicago public schools confirmed that grittier students were more likely to graduate, even when controlling for factors like family income and test scores. However, the speaker highlights a critical gap: science knows very little about how to build grit. They emphasize that talent doesn’t guarantee grit, and while **growth mindset** (the belief that abilities can improve with effort) is a promising approach, more research and testing are needed.

The speaker concludes by calling for a gritty approach to understanding and fostering grit in children, urging the audience to test ideas, measure success, and be willing to fail and learn in the process. The key takeaway is that grit matters profoundly, but how to cultivate it remains an open question that requires collective effort and perseverance.
