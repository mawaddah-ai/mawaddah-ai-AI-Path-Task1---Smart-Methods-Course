this repository contains task 1 files of AI learning paths - smart methods

steps :
1- by using teachable machine I trained an AI model to define if the picture represents Katniss Everdeen or Peeta Mellark (the hunger gameâ€™s main character) 

  1.1- adding images of each character 

  1.2-training the model
 
  1.3-testing the model by uploading different images and positions of the characters

  1.4- the model got some error result, so I added other images to the model, so it can recognize more pictures 1.5test other pictures 
 

2- exporting the model to the local environment (laptop) and by using bycharm I coded a program to represent the model output 

  2.1-exporting the model data to the local environment 

  2.2-move the model file into the python program file 

  2.3-add some Improvements, so it can show the results in a better way 

  2.4-entering the paths of test pictures to the output terminal 

  2.5-checking results
